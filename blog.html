           <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-warning">What Is Full-Stack Web Development?</h4>
         <p>Full-stack developers are experts in both the <a href="#blog2">Front-end</a>  and <a href="#Blog3">Back-end</a>; so, the full stack of technology that makes up a website. 
          They are proficient in both <a href="#blog2">Front-end</a>  and <a href="#Blog3">Back-end</a> languages and frameworks, as well as in server, network and hosting environments. 
          To get to this breadth and depth of knowledge,
           most full-stack developers will have spent many years working in a variety of different roles. They also tend to be well-versed in both business logic and user experience,
            meaning they are not only well-equipped to get hands on, but can also guide and consult on strategy too.
          Rather than having to develop complex proprietary code every time for creating different websites, frameworks have become popular resources to make many processes more efficient and convenient.
           Libraries like jQuery are extremely popular for front-end developers using Javascript, as they can implement various functions that other developers have already cultivated and tested.
          </p>      
          <p>Javascript frameworks like AngularJS and EmberJS solve many of the challenges faced by front-end developers by developing conventions that can easily be implemented with any website.</p>  
          <p> On the backend, there are frameworks like Rails for the programming language of Ruby, Django for Python, and CakePHP for working with PHP.</p>  
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-warning">Why Become A Full-Stack Web Developer?</h4>
          <p>Given the choice to specialize in <a href="#blog2">Front-end</a>  and <a href="#Blog3">Back-end</a> development, why would any developer choose to learn the full spectrum? </p>
          <p> It goes back to the value of being a T-shaped person. You are more valuable to a team when you are able to address and discuss both aspects of the web development process and bridge the disconnect.</p>
           <p>In other words, one developer who can readily assess and communicate how a website should look, feel, and manipulate data while understanding the technical limitations of such implementations will be a respected and valuable member of any team or company.</p>
           <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-warning">How Become A Full-Stack Web Developer.</h4>
           <p>To become a full-stack developer, you will need to gather quite some years of industry experience. You will need to learn both front-end and back-end languages, as well as the ins and outs of databases and storage. In fact, you can’t just study to become a full-stack developer; </p>
           <p>it’s all about constantly learning and getting as much experience as you can in both front and back-end development. </p>

          <h2 class="text-info font-weight-bold">Front-end Developer</h2>
          <p class="h6">Title description, jan 8, 2020</p>
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-warning">What Is Front-End Web Development?</h4>
          <p>This skillset involves the actual presentation of your website—how the information in your website is laid out in browsers and on mobile devices as well. 
            A dedicated front-end developer will be very experienced working with HTML and CSS as well as the scripting language, JavaScript. With these languages, the developer can very efficiently
             manipulate the information on a website to make it appealing and effective.</p>
           <p> Everything that you actually see on a website—the layout, the positioning of text and images, colors, fonts, buttons, and so on—are all factors that the front-end developer must consider.</p>
           <h3>language Used in Front-end</h3>
           <ul class="px-5">
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3> Front-end frameworks and Libraries</h3>
        <ul class="px-5">
          <li>Bootstrap</li>
          <li>AngularJS</li>
          <li>React.js</li>
          <li>jQuery</li>
          <li>SASS</li>

        </ul>
        <p>The main goal of a front-end developer is to provide the platform for visitors to interact with, a platform which provides and receives information. This means some developers will be well-versed in web design and using software such as Photoshop and Illustrator to create graphics and themed layouts.</p>
         <p>Additional skillsets of a front-end developer could include user experience design and user interface design, skills which help a team evaluate the best methods of displaying and collecting information. A front-end developer who possesses these design skills is potentially more valuable as they can identify the look and feel of a site while assessing the technical capabilities of such a design at the same time. Although this additional
            skillset might be useful to a developer, they are certainly not a requirement for the job, and more and more companies are seeing the value in hiring UX & UI designers to focus solely on this aspect of website development.</p>
